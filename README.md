# KEA Fullstack WikiSite

A fullstack movie and TV series explorer web app built as part of my studies at KEA (Copenhagen School of Design and Technology). This project consumes the [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to deliver dynamic search and listing of trending movies and shows.
